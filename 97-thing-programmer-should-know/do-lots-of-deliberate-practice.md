You do deliberate practice to improve your ability to perform task. Deliberate practice means repetition, it means performing the task with the aim of increasing your mastery of one or more aspects of the task. Research has shown the main factor in acquiring expertise is time spent doing deliberate practice.

- Mary Poppendieck: "There is broad consensus among researches of experts performance that  inborn talent does not account for much more than a threshold: you have to have a minimum amount of natural ability to get started in a sport or profession. After that, the people who excel are the one who work the hardest."

There is little point deliberately practicing something you are already and expert at. Deliberate practice means practicing something you are not good at.

- Peter Norvig:  "The key (to developing expertise) is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, tying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes".

- Mary Poppendieck: "Deliberate practice does not mean doing what you are good at, it means challenging yourself, doing what you are not good at. So it's not necessarily fun".
