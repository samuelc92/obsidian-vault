Instead of simply correcting mistakes in code, establish common coding guidelines.

Have a regular code review day each week. Spend a couple of hours in a review meeting. Rotate the reviewee every meeting in a simple round-robin pattern.

You should do code review because they increase code quality and reduce defect rate.
