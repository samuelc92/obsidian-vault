A comment explaining what a piece of code should already say is an invitation to change code structure or coding conversions so the code speaks for itself. Instead of compensating for a poor method or class names, rename them. Instead of commenting sections in long functions, extract smaller functios whose names capture the former sections' intent. Try to express as much as possible through code. Comment what the code cannot say, not simple what it does not say.
