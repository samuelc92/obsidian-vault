Pairs programming benefits:

- Reduce the "truck factor": It's a slightly morbid thought experiment, but how many of your team members would have to be hit by a truck before the team become unable to complete the final deliverable? If you have been rotating tasks among pairs, there is always someone else who has the knowledge and can complete the work;
- Solve problems effectively: If you are pair programming and you run into a challenging problem, you always have someone to discuss it with;
- Integrate smoothly: If your current task involves calling another piece of code, you hope the names of the methods, the docs, and the tests are descriptive enough to give you a gasp of what it does. If not, pairing with a developer who was involved in writing that code will give you better overview and faster integration into your own code;
- Mitigate interruptions: If someone need to stop working for a small period of time, his/hers pair programming can keep on working and, when she/he return his/hers partner is still in the flow and they will quickly catch up;
- Bring new team members up to speed quicly: with pair programming, and a suitable rotation of pairs and tasks, newcomers quickly get to know both the code an the other team members;
