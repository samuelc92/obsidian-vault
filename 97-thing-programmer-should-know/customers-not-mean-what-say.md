Customers do not mean what they say: Challenge your customers early and challenge them often. Don't simply restate what they told you they wanted in their words. Swapping out words in the conversation with them and judging their reaction. You'd see how many times that the term "customers" has a completely different meaning to the term "client". Discuss topics numerous times with your customers before you decide that you understand what they need. Talk with more people about the same topic in separate conversations. Use visual aids in you conversations. This could be as simple as using a whiteboard in a meeting, as easy as creating a visual mock-up early in the design phase, or as complex as crafting a functional prototype.
