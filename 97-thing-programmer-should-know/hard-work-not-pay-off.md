If you are trying to be focused and productive for more than 30 hours a week you are probably working too hard. You should consider reducing the workload to become more effective and get more done. To avoid wasted work, you must allow time to observe the effects of what you are doing, reflect over the things that you see, and change your behavior accordingly. Be focused on the project, contribute as much as you can by finding smart solutions, improve your skills, reflect on what you are doing, and adapt your behavior. Act like a professional: prepare, effect, observe, reflect, and change.
