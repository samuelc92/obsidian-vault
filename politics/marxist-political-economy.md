The capitalism system converted the labour power of the worker into a commodity that is bought and sold freely in the marketplace.
Under capitalism employees work a period of the day to pay their wage salary and another periods for the maintenance and growth of the capitalist. This additional value, which every worker produces, over and above the value necessary to earn his wage and maintain himself, Marx called surplus value, that is the source of profit and wealth of the capitalist class.

The capitalist desperates to earn more and more profits, it increases production and cut wage rates of this workers throwing them to the poverty. As most of the population are within worker class, their capacity to buy goods produced are decrease, resulting in a crisis of overproduction where the market is flooded with unsold goods.
