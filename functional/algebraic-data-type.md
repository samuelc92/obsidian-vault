Algebraic Data Type (ADT) is a composite of types, that is, a type formed by the combination of other types. For example:

Currency = USD | EUR | GBP (it is known as SUM that is also known as discriminated union or disjoint union)  
Money = Amount * Currency (It is PRODUCT, which can be read as AND)
