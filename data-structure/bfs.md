# Breadth First Search (BFS)

- finds the shortest path using the Queue data structure;
- We walk through all nodes on the same level passing to the next level in BFS;
- BFS is slower than [[dfs]];
- BFS perfoms better when the target is close to the source;
- BFS necessitates more memory;
- Node that have been traversed multiple times are removed from the queue;
- Backtracking is not an option in BFS;
- It is based on the FIFO (First in, First out);
