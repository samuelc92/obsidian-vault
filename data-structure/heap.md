# Heap

It is a special tree-based non-linear data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. A binary tree is said to be complete if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all elements as left as possible.

## Types os heaps

### Max-Heap

- In a Max-Heap the data element present at the root node must be the greates among all the data elements present in the tree;
- This property should be recursively true for all sub-trees of that binary tree;

### Min-Heap

- In a Min-Heap the data element present at the root node must be the smallest (or minimum) among all the data elements present in the tree;
- This property should be recursively true for all sub-trees of that binary tree;
