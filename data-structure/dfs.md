# Depth First Search (DFS)

- DFS finds the shortest path using the Stack data structure;
- Begins at the root node and proceeds as far as possible through the nodes until it reaches the leaf;
- DFS is faster than [[bfs]];
- It performs better when the target is far from the source;
- DFS necessitates less memory;
- When there are no more nodes to visit, the visited nodes are added to the stack and then removed;
- The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that employs the concept of backtracking;
- It is based on the LIFO (Last in, First out);
