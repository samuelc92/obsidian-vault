Two types of message brokers:

- AMQP/JMS style message broker: The broker assigns individual messages to consumers and consumers acknowledge individual messages when they have been successfully processed. Messages are deleted from the broker once they have been achnowledged. This approach is appropriate as an asynchronous form of [[rpc]], for example in a task queue, where the exact order of message processing is not important and where there is no need to go back and read old messages again after they have been processed.

- Log-based message broker: The broker assigns all messages in a partition to the same consumer node, and always delivers messages in the same order. Parallelism is achieved through partitioning, and consumers track their progress by checkpointing the offset of he last message they have processed. The broker retains messages on disk, so it is possible to jump back and reread old messages if necessary.
