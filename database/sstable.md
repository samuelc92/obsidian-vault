SSTable - Sorted String Table and LSM-Tree: Change to the format of segment files. The sequence of key-values pairs is sorted by key. Moreover, it is required that each key only appears once within each merged segment file.

SSTable has several big advantages over log segments with hash indexes.
- Merging segments is simple and efficient even if the files are bigger than the available memory. The approach is like the one used in the [[merge-sort]], you start reading the input file side by side, look at the first key in each file, copy the lowest key to the output file, and repeat. When multiple segments contain the same key, we can keep the value from the most recent segment and discard the values in older segments.
- In order to find a particular key in the file, you no longer need to keep an index of all the key in memory. For example: say you're looking for the key 'handword', but you don't know the exact offset of that key in the segments file. However, you do know the offsets for the keys 'handbag' and 'handsome', and because of the sorting you know that 'handwork' must appear between those two. This means you can jump to the offset for 'handbag' and scam from there until you find 'handwork'.
