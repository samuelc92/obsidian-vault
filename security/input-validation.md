- Conduct data validation on trusted system (Server Side)
- Specify proper character sets such as UTF-8 for all sources of input
- Encode data to a common character set before validating
- All validation failure should result in REJECTION.
- Determine if the system supports UTF-8 extended character sets
	- if so, validate after the UTF-8 decoding is completed not before
- Validate parameters, urls, HTTP headers.
- Use automated postbacks from JavaScript
- Validate data from re-directs
- Validate for expected:
	- data types
	- data ranges
	- data length
- Validate all input against an allowed/approved list
