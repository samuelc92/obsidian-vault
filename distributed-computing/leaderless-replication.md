The client sends the write command to all database replica, for this example let considered  that we have 3 replicas, in parallel, if two at least replicas accept the write, we consider the write to be successful. Now image that the unavailable node comes back online, and clients start reading  from it. Any writes that happened while the node was down are missing from that node. Thus, if you read from that node, you may get outdated values as responses. To solve this problem, when a client reads from the database, it doesn't just send its request to one replica, the request is also sent to several nodes in parallel. The client may get different responses from different nodes. Version numbers are used to determine which value is newer.
