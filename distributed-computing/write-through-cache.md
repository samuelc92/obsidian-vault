In this cache system the write operation is done both in the cache and in the Database, then the operation is considered success only if both write is done success.
The downside of this system is that the latency of the write will be worst because of the both operations (write into the cache, write into the Database).
On the other hand it is good for application that re-read the information quickly because it guarantee consistency.
